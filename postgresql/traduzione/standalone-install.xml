This file helps in generating the INSTALL text file that lives in the
top level directory of the distribution. The exact process is like
this:

1. Paste together with installation.xml

2. Process with jade to HTML (use -V nochunks)

3. Remove "Chapter 1" heading

4. Save as text file in Netscape

5. Put in place of old INSTALL file

Running 'make INSTALL' in the doc/src/sgml directory will do 1 through
3 for you.

<!--
The standalone version has some portions that are different from the
version that is integrated into the full documentation set, in
particular as regards links. The following are essentially SGML's
equivalent of C's #ifdef and friends. The other end of this is in
installation.xml.

 <!ENTITY % standalone-ignore  "IGNORE">
 <!ENTITY % standalone-include "INCLUDE">

<!--
When you're building the full documentation set, you want to flip the
IGNORE and INCLUDE.
